This is the backend website for the app that was developed. The main functionality and documentation of that app is listed here: https://github.com/AdilAnsari6/FBLAManager

The goal was to create a fully functional club manager application that members could use to read announcements, organize meetings, and other club related activities. My role in the project was to create this backend website, which manages the database for all the of the information the app accesses, as well as being the place where club managers could login to create announcements, schedule meetings, and manage the members in their club.
